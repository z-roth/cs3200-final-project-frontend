## CS3200 Database Design: Final Project Front End

Welcome!

This is the front end repository for my final project.

To use the front end, you must have the back-end running on your machine as well. Please start running the back-end if you have not already.

Firstly, make sure you have Node installed and added to PATH. You can install Node at https://nodejs.org/en/download/. I am using Node version LTS to develop this project.

After verifying node is installed with node -v on the command line, navigate to the root folder of this repository and run `npm install`. This will install all of the dependencies used to build this project. After that is complete, run `npm start` to start the program. By default, the program will run on `localhost:3000`, which you can access from your browser. If the program has an error, make sure to navigate back to `localhost:3000/` as there are some bugs with the how the links work.

All of this setup can be quite complex and there is a lot of room for error. If you need any help at all, please email me and I would be happy to promptly assist!
